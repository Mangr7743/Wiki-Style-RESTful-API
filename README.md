Simple RESTful API Design

This is a RESTful API designed in the style of a wiki. This API has /articles and /articles/:specificArticles routes. The API allows for GET request to list all articles or specific articles, POST specific articles, UPDATE (PUT or PATCH) specific articles, and DELETE all or specific articles.

The API utilizes MongoDB as the database for creating and updating documents. I am simply connecting a local database with POSTMAN to test the API features and functionality.
